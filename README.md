Clothing Store project assignment

In a clothing store, you can buy shoes, shirts, suit jackets and trousers.
Each product has a name, brand, price, and color.
All clothes have sizes but they use different standards:
• for shirts - XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL
• for shoes - 39 - 46
• for jackets and trousers - 42-66 (using only the even numbers - eg. 42, 44, 46, etc.)
If a client buys 3 or more products they get a 20% discount. On Tuesday all shirts have a 10% discount and all
shoes have a 25% discount. Both discounts can’t be applied for the same item. If a product is applicable for both
discounts, only the bigger one is applied.

Objective is that class Cashier has a method to print a receipt. The method accepts a cart (collection of products)
and the date and time of purchase. It should print in the console, all purchased products with their price, the total
sum, and the total discount in predefined format.

No user input is used, the data should be predefined.
